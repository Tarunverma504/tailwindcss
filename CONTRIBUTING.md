- Have a look at open issues. They contain the list of algorithms/DS we plan
to be implemented. Pick an unassigned issue.
- You can also create a new issue for an algorithm that is not in the list.
- **Make sure you are assigned for the issue.**
- Code with following the styleguide defined below.
- Send a PR.
- Be sure to not include any compiled binaries in the patch.
- While sending a PR make sure you follow one issue per PR rule.
